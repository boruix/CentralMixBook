## Features
* Can add and save cocktail ingredients to your inventory
  * Easily toggle and filter which ingredients are in-stock / out-of-stock in your inventory
  * Ingredients are categorized by type (base spirits, bitters, modifiers, sweeteners, juices, toppers, other) and subtype
  * Price and supplier information or directions for homemade ingredients can be saved
  * Can see a list of all the specs that the ingredient is used in
* Can add and save cocktail specs with custom fields for type, origin, ingredients, garnish, glassware, ice, directions, and notes
  * Can add ingredients to your inventory while adding a spec
  * Easily filter to quickly find which cocktails can be made using the ingredients in your inventory
  * Specs can be organized by cocktail type, origin, or glassware
  * Can favorite specs for easy access

## To-Do
* Add a search bar above both inventory and specs views
* Introduce a new tab that can provide a list of missing ingredients to purchase ranked by versatility (missing ingredients that can complete more specs will be ranked higher), using either your favorite specs or all specs, within an optional total price range (up to a dollar amount and/or at least a dollar amount - for shipping requirements when ordering online).
Specific ingredients can be pinned to this list, so they will always be included if they are missing from your inventory.
* Include a broader ingredient definition in specs (e.g. London Dry Gin or Gin instead of Beefeater Gin, and the ingredient in the spec will be displayed as in-stock if any brands of London Dry Gin or Gin are in-stock in your inventory)
